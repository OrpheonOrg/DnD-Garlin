-Half-elf, was given to the Western Temple of Light, dedicated to Lathander, as an orphan when born, probably because parents had her out of wedlock and didn't want to deal with the social problems of raising a half-elf
-Was named Amafrey Lath, latter name being given to all such temple orphans
-Grew up in the Western Temple of Light, became acolyte of Lathander
-Quite attractive, solid 8-9/10.
-Good student, diligent worker, generally helpful, but strong curiosity, which was not hindered as it was mostly focused on matters religious and this pleased the scholarly teachers
-In particular, gifted with languages, and hence often given things to translate
-Read of some forbidden rituals in a work to translate, curiosity got the better of her and she did them to see what would happen. Caught a glimpse of the Outer God Gosa, a completely unknown entity in this world, except for a handful of lone cultists like the one who wrote said ritual
-The beauty of the visions surpassed what her mind had imagined, for one moment she perceived the whole of creation through the Sacred Circle, before her brain screamed. She wanted more though, and through the ritual demanded more, unintentionally making a pact. Gosa, like other Outer Gods (see Yog-Sothoth), likes being known, and as such gladly provided. Her taste for knowledge of the occult exploded, and she began devouring any text she could find about it, and also experimenting rather wantonly with it.
-The Western Temple of Light didn't want her around anymore at some point, but due to her diligence and previously good reputation pitied her and sent her out with the standard acolyte attire most used for their pilgrimage, under agreement that she was not to return, nor seek refuge in any other temple of Lathander
-She has since wandered about, using her education to sometimes find gold as a hired scribe or translator, and often just eating on the mercy of tavern patrons. Her acolyte robes let her wander mostly unmolested as long as she stuck to the reputable parts of cities. She has not really dared to leave the city and wander into the wilderness yet, not alone, although she'd like to because the city outside the temple doesn't really satisfy her and she feels like she's only treadmilling here.

  Is this character a hero?
    Not really. Likes to be helpful and will generally try to improve the world as per worldview of Lathander, but has bigger priorities and her life goal is to find more of Gosa.

  Who are her parents?
    Real parents are an unknown human and elf who decided to have sex but couldn't deal with a half-elf child.
    She grew up under priests of Lathander in the Western Temple of Light.

  Why is she an adventurer?
    Thrown out of the temple, wants to get out of the city but safely, and to find more of Gosa if possible.

  What are the immediate goals?
    Find more cool rituals; after all, Gosa was seen through one.
    Find people that can be trusted and lived around with, because everyday life problems are hassle and also the world outside is dark, ugly, and unsatisfying.
    Understand things, particularly anything regarding gods and spirits and mysterious rituals. Magic of the more mathematical kind doesn't interest her as much, although it does some, but it's especially those things with a mystique or occult flair that do.

  Is she religious?
    Yes, grew up worshipping Lathander, but the visions completely dethroned him and now her adoration is entirely towards Gosa, seeing him as the absolute frame through which to see the world, all is within him.

  Is she merciful?
    Yes. Will tend to disregard things that aren't obviously humanlike (eg. insectoids or whatever isn't considered humanlike by your average educated person), but otherwise yes. Was not raised to kill.
