Geography
  Island of Ilkoth, west of the delta of the Flerg river
  Surprisingly mountainous, probably volcanic origins
  For some reason, *heavy* spirit presence on the island, and as such largely considered haunted
    As a result, a lot of people go crazy in one way or another, or get possessed, or etc
    Wasn't always so, though, and some humans still live there, in rather isolated tribes, with various coping mechanisms for the haunting

Rôl tribe
  Fishing culture along the western shore of the island, facing away from the mainland
  Have symbiotic relationship with a certain line of spirits called the Quori
    The Rôl worship the Quori, and host them in their own bodies, letting them act on the world and experience the mortal world
    In exchange the Quori protect the Rôl from other spirits, and give them various magical abilities
      Almost all Rôl have some degree of telepathic ability, and some have more specialized abilities around their functions
    Quori are immortal, but flighting
      They also aren't really individuals, Quori are kind of school-fish like, many facets behaving in more or less unity, but not an "individual" per se
      As such they can be much more ephemeral and mutating than humans
  Tribe functions with "bloodlines", families which keep the same Quori guardians through generations
    These bloodlines are often tied with land and function
      the Quori implicitly helps maintain knowledge and wisdom through generations, which "anchors" these functions more than usual
    These bloodlines are usually named after their Quori
  Because knowledge is conserved through Quori in this way, because of emphasis on telepathical communication, and also because >humans, Rôl never invented or adopted a system to read or write

Tana Bloodline
  The Tana bloodline is one of many Rôl bloodlines
  Specializes in medicine and alchemy, creating poultices and potions
  Most Tana were healers, and as such were spread out fairly far across Rôl settlements
  Because spread out, and because alchemy rewards experimentation and curiosity, Tana are one of the more novelty-hungry Rôl bloodlines
  They are one of the few bloodlines who occasionally will send unneeded members out to the world in a Pilgrimage, to gather recipies and wisdom from the greater world
    Most never return, but even if they die far away, the Quori retains their lessons, even if they only communicate it in fragmented flashes of intuition and dreams

Sarya-Tana - Origins
  Sarya is a young woman of the Tana
  She was born as part of a wave of many children, more than usual
  She stood out from the other Tana mostly in surprisingly good physical condition, able to swim, climb, and fight more than other Tana, even able to keep up with members of more martial tribes like the Bhakan
  Accordingly, she spent a lot of time doing these things, and because of the many children, wasn't really forced otherwise until late
  While she (eventually) learned the Tana trade of healing and brewing, she didn't excel at it
  The large number of children in her generation meant that many of the needs were filled, and there was some leeway
  The Tana decided, seeing all of these circumstances, and to her enthusiastic approval, to send her off in a Pilgrimage
  The Quori began to send her many dreams of foreign peoples and the tongues they spoke, so that she may find her way through them
  A year later, she left, with good equipment and having left some blood in the communal grave, so that even in the event of her probable non-return she would still lie there

Sarya-Tana - Journey
  Sarya travelled east by following the southern shore of Ilkoth, mostly alone, and sometimes attaching herself to other tribes
  Most here knew of the Rôl, and so while some were hostile most didn't cause her problems
  Eventually, she made her way to the eastern shore, and hitched a ride on a trader ship towards the delta
  She then followed the Flerg up north, until Flergen, at which point she followed increasing density until she arrived in Petteln
  Hearing that goblins were masters of alchemy, she travelled north towards their lands
  She was refused entry into Salsk, though, for some bureaucratic reason, so she went north to Ulan-Ulde thinking to try that instead
  Between the two she was picked up by a merchant who saw opportunity and smuggled her in
  He tried sexually advancing on her in the city, though, and she fled. She managed to find a living in the less reputable areas, by making drugs for one of the criminal underlords (the same one Hadry bet with)
